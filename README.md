# Zusu-Mokshpat
Snake and Ladders built as tech assessment for Zusu Gaming Studio.

### A 3D Horror-Themed Snake & Ladder Prototype

---

## 🎯 Overview
**Zusu-Mokshpat** reimagines the classic Snake & Ladder board game as a **psychological escape journey** through a **dilapidated haunted building**.  
Each numbered tile represents a **room** or **hallway section**, where players advance by rolling a 3D dice.  
Hidden glowing doors (ladders) lead forward, while collapsing floors (snakes) plunge players back into earlier rooms.

Developed as part of the **Zusu Gaming – Technical Assessment**, using **Unity 6000.2.6f2**.
